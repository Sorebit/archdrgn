### Fishing
- If nothing catched, server has some internal php error. Response then looks like this:
  + `Undefined offset: 0<br />File: map.controller.php<br />Line: 238{"points":0,"status":"OK","item":0,"item_name":null,"userAccountActive":false}`
- Otherwise it's just JSON
- For some reason this is what is used to post to fish
  + "fish" = "at the age old pond - a frog leaps into water - a deep resonance"
